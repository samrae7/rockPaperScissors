### Running Unit Tests

These are written in [Jasmine][jasmine], which we run with the [Karma][karma] test runner.
We provide a Karma configuration file to run them.

* The configuration is found at `karma.conf.js`.
* The unit tests are found next to the code they are testing and have an `.test.js` suffix (e.g.
  `view1_test.js`).

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
npm test
```

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. Moreover, Karma will start
watching the source and test files for changes and then re-run the tests whenever any of them
changes.
This is the recommended strategy; if your unit tests are being run every time you save a file then
you receive instant feedback on any changes that break the expected code functionality.

You can also ask Karma to do a single run of the tests and then exit. This is useful if you want to
check that a particular version of the code is operating as expected. The project contains a
predefined script to do this:

```
npm run test-single-run
```


## Loading Angular Asynchronously

The `angular-seed` project supports loading the framework and application scripts asynchronously.
The special `index-async.html` is designed to support this style of loading. For it to work you must
inject a piece of Angular JavaScript into the HTML page. The project has a predefined script to help
do this:

```
npm run update-index-async
```

This will copy the contents of the `angular-loader.js` library file into the `index-async.html`
page. You can run this every time you update the version of Angular that you are using.
